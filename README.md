# Step Detection
The task is to predict the start and end of human steps from a set of 6 signals. The data was recorded using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, which were held in the hand during 4 different activities, including simple walking, walking up and down stairs, and standing still.




##### Approach 1 is for Multi-layer Perceptron Network.
##### Approach 2 is for LSTM with Fragmentation.
##### Approach 3 is for LSTM with Fourier transformation and filtration.
